## Development Tips

Here are some useful development tips I've gathered throughout my career:

### 1. Always Use Version Control
- Commit early and often
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use branching strategies effectively

### 2. Code Review Best Practices
- Review code for logic, not syntax
- Be constructive in feedback
- Learn from others' approaches

### 3. Testing Is Essential
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Aim for good test coverage
- Keep tests simple and focused

### 4. Documentation Matters
- Document your APIs
- Keep README files updated
- Comment complex logic

These practices have helped me become a better developer and team member.
