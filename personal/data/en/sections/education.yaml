It outlines the components—such as Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007—and their interactions with other Microsoft systems. The solution integrates with IT infrastructure and existing telephony (including legacy PBX and PSTN) to deliver videoconferencing, audio conferencing, and instant messaging within Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007."
